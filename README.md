I participated in an awesome business project on Forage as a part of my learning path.
I recently received a certificate of completion for Tata's Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights, Virtual Experience Programme through Forage.
This programme presented me with an array of skills, including problem-solving, effective communication, data analysis, data cleaning, data interpretation, and data presentation and visualisation.

ðŸ’¦ The CEO requested a revenue trend to determine whether retail sales are seasonal.
ðŸ”Ž The CEO needed to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month.
ðŸ”Ž The CMO of the online retail store requested access to data on the top 10 customers according to revenue. Targeting higher revenue-generating customers and ensuring that they remain satisfied with their products.
ðŸ”Ž The CMO is also interested in viewing the top 10 countries that generate the highest revenue.
ðŸ”Ž Lastly, the CMO needed to know the quantity sold along with the revenue generated.
